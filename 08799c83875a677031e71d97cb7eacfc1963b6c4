      "message": "Mitaka jobs are failing for the last two weeks and it seems no much effort is going into fixing them. (Though now I think we\u0027ll have some fix soon, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1673424)\n\nStill we have capacity issues on CentOS CI, so we should use wisely our gate jobs. I think we can start to shift our focus to newton and use the periodic jobs to make sure nothing is broken for mitaka.\n\nI added this justification to the commit message.",
