      "message": "_lock_socket needs to be a global variable, otherwise it will get garbage collected when function exits. This is a simple way to make it global, as opposed to declaring it out of the function, using global _lock_socket, and then assigning a socket to it. It never gets references outside of this function, so I thought I could keep it self contained.",
