It meant -- verifying which promotion hash had the least number of failures, so we could focus only on failing jobs.\nWhen I worked on this code, it revealed disturbing pattern of multiple \"promotions\" happening for the same hash, separated by few seconds.\n\nI was planning to focus on ruck_rover script, and later investigate why we\u0027re seeing multiple the same promotions.",
