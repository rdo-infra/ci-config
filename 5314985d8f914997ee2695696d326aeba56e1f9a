      "message": "This script will run every 5-10 minutes vs. the quickstart promotion of 4h upstream, so I think this will not happen.\n\nHowever when we have history with the promotions query, I can imagine an improvement where we step through the older hashes on the current_name and check for the jobs until we hit old_hashes \u003d\u003d new_hashes. This would avoid the problem when we promote too fast and could never promote the older hashes.",
