      "message": "These are relatively low volume repos but they are essencial for our bread and butter operations. Taking hours to gate a change would be a pain and impact the whole team. Would you mind if we discuss this at more depth on the scrum today and get a consensus on the concurrency?",

The full gate trigger is the full deploy gate and is triggered manually with a \"full-ci-check\" comment when a patch is otherwise ready to merge, and could conceivably break something in the full deploy.",
