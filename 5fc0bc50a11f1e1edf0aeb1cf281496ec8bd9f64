      "message": "I this this is a nice naming improvement but using non-alphanumeric characters in sections here and in the requirements makes my spidey sense tingling. I know it is probably supposed to work with any unicode string within the [] but I have to feeling that somehow, somewhere it\u0027s going to cause hard-to-figure-out troubles.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t see advantages for converting this script to object oriented. It\u0027s not a library, we\u0027re not reusing any part of it outside of the script, even within the script the use of OOP is very limited and the improvements it brings (different style of logging) can be solved by the previous state fairly easily as well.\n\nMoreover I made that script intentionally procedural. I think it is nice to keep function and data separate. It adds the convenience of not needing to call functions with 5 arguments, but makes the distinction between data and code \"mushy\" and mixed what accesses and modifies what data.",

If we make the requirement for the promotion to have a container job successful, then we don\u0027t have to specifically check for a containers job being there, it\u0027s explicitly going to be there because we\u0027re already promoting.\n\nIf you need the parsed containers list, I\u0027d check/fetch that file in the containers ansible script, not here.",
