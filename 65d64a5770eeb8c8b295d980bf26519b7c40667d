This misses the whole point of having a \u0027single point of truth\u0027 for promotions.\n\nI much favor the solution with https://review.rdoproject.org/r/10103 -- and solving the syncing of the promotions internally. I\u0027m not even sure why the internal build server needs any knowledge of the promotions though.",
