      "message": "What do we gain from multiple runs per day?\n\nMost changes we do affect cockpits and for those to take effect we have to manually intervene on these systems anyway. Actually its only system updates (yum/dnf) which we do less often with this change, although \"less often\" still means once a day.\n\nThinking about our different timezones, one day gives us enough time to detect and fix errors. For example, when i apply a breaking change in my afternoon, then you might detected this when i am off already. When i am online again on the next day, I have time to fix this bug before it spreads to all other systems.",
