      "message": "This looks in good shape.(want to take another pass before +2)\n\nA couple of questions and possible future improvements which we can target in follow-up patches.\n\n1. When we compare with upstream job results do we consider branch?\n\n For ex. periodic-tripleo-ci-centos-9-scenario001-standalone-wallaby fails when we compare results with upstream - we search for a job: tripleo-ci-centos-9-scenario001-standalone - do we limit the results to wallaby branch or do we currently check result for all branches?\n\n\n2. We are currently not comparing results for featureset jobs because we don\u0027t run featureset01/20/35/64 jobs in upstream but we can possibly compare them with rdo third party check jobs.\n\nFor ex.\n\nhttps://review.rdoproject.org/zuul/builds?job_name\u003dperiodic-tripleo-ci-centos-9-ovb-3ctlr_1comp-featureset001-master\u0026skip\u003d0\n\ncan be compared with \n\nhttps://review.rdoproject.org/zuul/builds?job_name\u003dtripleo-ci-centos-9-ovb-3ctlr_1comp-featureset001\u0026branch\u003dmaster\u0026skip\u003d0\n\n\n3. Comparision in downstream jobs will not return anything.\n\nIt may be a good idea to compare with rdo jobs instead.",

      "message": "ad 1.\nNo, we don\u0027t. It\u0027s implemented the same way like in the past -- strip \"periodic\" and \"branch\" from job name, and query upstream zuul about results.\nad 2.\nI\u0027m not following what you\u0027re saying Sandeep. Do you mean to switch from upstream zuul to rdo zuul for all? Just for featuresets?\nad 3.\nAgain, I\u0027m not understanding what you mean here. downstream + rdo? downstream + upstream?\n\nCan you clarify it a bit more?\nThanks.",
