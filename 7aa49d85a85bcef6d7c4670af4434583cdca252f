BUT looks like there is no .patch tags for the 1.5 series so that should be OK https://github.com/openstack/openstacksdk/tags \n\nwhere did you get the 1.5.0 from though? perhaps we need the one from august (1.4.0?) ... the storyboard bug is from early september and 1.5.0 was tagged 31st august so it may contain the issue just based on the dates?",
