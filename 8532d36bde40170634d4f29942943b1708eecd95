If RDO Phase1 promotes it shouldn\u0027t try to tag those images as \"passed-ci\".\n\nI agree we should tag images both with the full hash and the current promotion name (i.e. current-tripleo, current-tripleo-rdo, etc.). We can make a special case for current-tripleo tagged as \"passed-ci\" but I highly recommend to change the upstream jobs to try to fetch \u0027current-tripleo\u0027 instead to consolidate the naming here as well.",
