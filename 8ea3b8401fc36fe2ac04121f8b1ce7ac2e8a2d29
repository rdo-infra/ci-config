      "message": "I did not get it...\nAs you know this was supposed to be a temporary solution to copy containers, I did in go as a learning project, and at the end, we are relying a lot on this. The first version in python, we had to change all the time as the python api with docker was also changing a lot. Using go, using the same api as docker uses was a good solution. And if what you meant about Job security, is to maintain my job, I\u0027m very offended by your comment.\nFeel free to create a python or shell script solution to copy the containers.",

      "message": "thanks for replying Arx\nI know the history behind it but issues like this demonstrate how this has quickly become something that mainly you know how to update and maintain. That is bad for you and also bad for the team if you move on or if you are away or busy with other things.\n\nI don\u0027t want to have the discussion again in comments here ;) just to add that this is not _just_ about learning the language. It is also about how we are set up to use these languages. I mean for things like python or ansible we have some linting in place to help us catch issues. We aren\u0027t equipped in the same way for go.\n\nFor the \u0027job security\u0027 thing I think it is just a joke like \"you are the only one that knows how to update this \" --\u003e your job is safe :) . \n\nI am sorry if you were offended by that since my comment started this thread.\n\nLooks like things are OK now (I think you copied manually? ) -\u003e https://quay.io/organization/tripleozedcentos9\n\nAfter this change merges that should then happen whenever we promote right?",
