Otherwise we may end up with /vat/tmp/promoter_logs/promoter_logs if i read the following correctly:\n\nhttps://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/copy_module.html#parameter-src\n\nIf path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends with \"/\", only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with \"/\", the directory itself with all contents is copied.
