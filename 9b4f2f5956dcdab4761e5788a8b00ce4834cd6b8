      "message": "This is the things I\u0027m most unsure about. Raising an exception will completely block the run on every hash in all the phases for a particular branch. Also, what will happend in a next rerun ? will this pass or will block again ? Maybe it\u0027s better to put just an error in the log ? Or do a lot more than this and put an inhibitor to block this and any successful runs until the situation is solved ? or a rollback ?",
