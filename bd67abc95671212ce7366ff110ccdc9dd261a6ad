      "message": "Originally all the functions were implemented this way and in [1] we moved to using config dictionary because each of these function had multiple arguments and there were feedback that time to group these multiple variable using dictionary.\n\nCurrently, Because we are not modifying the config dictionary in our functions - its looks okay to pass config dict (even without creating dict copy[2])as argument as it reduce number of arguments we pass.\n\nI don\u0027t have strong objection either way and this comes down to personal style preferences[3]. If more contributor thinks having more variable instead of one big dict makes each function more readable than we should go with this.\n\nI have also tested this patch manually and it works.\n\nThanks dariusz.\n\n\n[1] https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-infra/ci-config/+/34576/8/ci-scripts/infra-setup/roles/rrcockpit/files/telegraf_py3/ruck_rover.py#379\n[2] https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-functions-modify-lists-dictionaries-python/\n[3] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23445663/should-i-use-multiple-variables-or-one-dictionary",
