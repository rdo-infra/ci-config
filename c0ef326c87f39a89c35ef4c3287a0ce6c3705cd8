      "message": "I am not in favor of this change, as commit message \"Changed function names to be more descriptive\" does not convince me â€“ WHY? This suffix is too generic, why not then renaming also the arguments to api_instance_variable, component_name_variable, etc.?\nIs it only because in some functions I saw there was a variable called `component`? Then I would probably change that variable to `component_name` or make it REALLY meaningful name here like `component_fetch`/`fetch_component` (because it seems to query the api_instance for latest builds statuses)",
