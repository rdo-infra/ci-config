      "message": "This runs from the promote server which has no openstack repos or packages. With your suggestion, we would still need to generate the URL to get the tripleo-common package from, but would have the added burden of package management.\n\nWe would also then have to deal with isolating the different releases, which currently can run in parallel, so that we didnt use the wrong package for the wrong release.\n\nThis patch does not add any dependence on github... that was there before this patch. It simply makes the list of containers accurate for the promote.",
