It\u0027s used in the creation of the local delorean repository in the tripleo-repos playbooks [1], and the only spot it\u0027s set in other than the roles themselves a zuul role for review.rdoproject.org-config that also manually sets the fact [2].\n\n[1] - https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-ci/blob/master/roles/tripleo-repos/tasks/main.yml#L73\n\n[2] - https://github.com/rdo-infra/review.rdoproject.org-config/blob/master/zuul.d/tripleoci.yaml#L61",
