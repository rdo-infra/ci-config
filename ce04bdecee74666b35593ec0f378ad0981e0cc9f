      "message": "I don\u0027t really think we can solve that problem though... If we have a problem reading the config file, then we cant setup logging. And if we can\u0027t setup logging, then we clearly can\u0027t log anything.\n\nI did move the config parsing and call to setup logging into main, so at least if it blows up at that stage it will be a bit more obvious what is going on from digging in to cron logs. It also ensures that if we make it into the try block we are guaranteed to get logs of any other issues.",
