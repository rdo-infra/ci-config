      "message": "This is how I implemented this function originally :)  When some concerns were raised that this function is taking too much attributes and we moved to cargs in below patch:-\n\nhttps://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-infra/ci-config/+/34576/8/ci-scripts/infra-setup/roles/rrcockpit/files/telegraf_py3/ruck_rover.py#b641\n\n^^ looks like we are partially reverting above patch with this patch. \n\nI think the part of problem here is setting individual variables from dict.\nfor ex\u003e distro \u003d args[\u0027distro\u0027] and then using individual var.. We could have moved to using args[\u0027distro\u0027] directly in the previous patch than the reassignment\n\nDariusz do we think having more attribute is much cleaner? I will revisit the patch again. ( +1 to revisit it again)",
