"""
This file contains implementation of the DlrnHash object.
To reach transparency for the operation of the other elements in the
promotion on both single pipeline and integration pipeline scenarios,
the complexity of the separation and difference between the two pipelines has
been moved to dlrn sections only.
The classes here in particular implement the separation as a metaclass that
when called with information to build a dlrn hash returns the proper class
based on the information present in the source
