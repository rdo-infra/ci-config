The staging environment provisioner should produce

- A hierarchy for overcloud images, so image promotion script can
  sftp to localhost and change the links accordingly
  see the overcloud_images subtree in sample/tree.txt
- A hierarchy for the overcloud_containers_yaml file, to pass to the container-push playbook
  as a list of containers to promote
  see the overclooud_contaienrs_yaml subtree in sample/tree.txt
- a set of images to push to source registry, so the promoter has the container to pull and
  push during the promotion run
  see sample/docker_images.txt
- a meta.yaml file used to cleanup any local and remote configuration, including the local
  subtrees and local/remote containers.
  see sample/meta.yaml

The tests for this section should check that the script produces all the elements consistently with the samples
