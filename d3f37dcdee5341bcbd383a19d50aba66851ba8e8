      "message": "why are we using go for this? Is there a technical reason/requirement? Otherwise lets please avoid that.\n\nas said many times this is not a comment about go but more about what we as a team will be called to maintain. if we are going to adopt a new language into our tooling there should be a wider discussion about that and understanding that we all have to invest time into it.\n\n[EDIT]: maybe because the existing skiplist.go is using go and so \u0027lets use go for the clean_skiplist too \u0027 kind of thing... :/",

      "message": "I think Marios is right here. We should avoid adding more golang code, because there is not enough expertise in our team to understand and review this code.\n\nI think, you should move required pieces of this code/file to the `skiplist.go` and keep it minimum.\n\nThe problem with Python vs. Golang is not speed. Golang uses coroutines, which allows for async. Python needs to be forced to use async.\n\nIf we\u0027re gonna reduce nested loops, it should significantly improve time execution of the code.",
