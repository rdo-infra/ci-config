Otherwise lets please avoid that.\n\nas said many times this is not a comment about go but more about what we as a team will be called to maintain. if we are going to adopt a new language into our tooling there should be a wider discussion about that and understanding that we all have to invest time into it.\n\n[EDIT]: maybe because the existing skiplist.go is using go and so \u0027lets use go for the clean_skiplist too \u0027 kind of thing... :/",
