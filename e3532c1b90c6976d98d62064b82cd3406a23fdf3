      "message": "Hello Dariusz,\n\nI am ruck/rovering this week and I didn\u0027t get a chance to look at the code. (I will review the code once I am off ruck/rovering)\n\nJust looking at the usage I don\u0027t understand the actual purpose of this patch, I mean patch is about \"Fetch jobs history at once\" and then we are also clubbing the removal of `--compare_upstream` flag. IMHO.. it would be good to write more details in the commit msg and list everything you are doing here.\n\nBased on the previous comment[1], I thought you want to compare with upstream always but based on testing [2] I don\u0027t see the upstream results by default. \n\nCould you please check [2] and see if that\u0027s what you intended to do here by removing `--compare_upstream`? \n\nMaybe we should discuss this patch may be in community/scrum/Separate mtg as attending the same review time is difficult because of the TZ difference.\n\n[1] https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-infra/ci-config/+/43307/21#message-2c8bf6a9e56e904d9e6fb52763dc8e024fd0e3b1\n[2] https://paste.openstack.org/show/bQfWci4lCX8TQWHWdbHJ/",
