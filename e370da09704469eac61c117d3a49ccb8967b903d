      "message": "1500 is the default, but it is overwritten in particular for rrcockpit on vexxhost. On incockpit (downstream cockpit) it should be 1500 because that vm is bridged to a physical network. for other hosts such as promoter and toolbox i am not changing it because they are not using docker and i do not want to change their ansible code (although it would be \"correct\") because their ansible code is probably not in sync with our playbooks anyway.\n\nThe hosts get the MTU for their network devices from OpenStack so there is no need to change their MTU manually. Only for docker this is required because docker does not look at network device mtu when creating bridges for docker networks.",
