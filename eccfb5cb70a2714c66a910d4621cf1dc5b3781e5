      "message": "Can you split this into multi-lines \\\n with \\\n backslashes ?\n\nOtherwise, an alternative implementation comes to mind although I\u0027m not crazy about it I thought I\u0027d at least bring it up.\n\nThere could be a (standalone) playbook in weirdo that uses the dlrn api module, not unlike the single-purpose playbook for ci.centos.org logs: https://github.com/rdo-infra/weirdo/blob/master/playbooks/logs-ci-centos.yml\n\nYou could run, say,\n\ntox -e ansible-playbook -- -i ${{WORKSPACE}}/hosts playbooks/dlrn-report.yml (with a way to pass vars, we can discuss there\u0027s different ways)\n\nThe reason why I mention this is that we\u0027d get to see the dlrn-api update in the ARA report.\n\nAnother thing I could see happening is a simple ansible role that sets up the dlrn-api client and comes with a set of sane defaults. For example the URL should be fairly static (trunk-api.rdoproject.org?) but then the \"endpoint\" (api-centos-master-uc) varies and should definitely be set.",
