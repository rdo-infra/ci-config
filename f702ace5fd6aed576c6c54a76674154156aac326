      "message": "I missed your answer here from patchset 8:\n\n\"I need some hardcoding here. I need to find what is the root of the ci-config repo. abspath gives the full path of the promoter script. From that, I have to remove the relative path of the script after the root of the repo. I don\u0027t kow if there\u0027s a way to get get without hardcoding.\"\n\nWhat I was suggesting is to use this command:\n\n    os.path.abspath(sys.path[0])\n\nThis is used below on line 197 for the same purpose: to figure out where the script is run from, but it returns the directory instead of the full path including the script name. I\u0027d prefer to use the same method throughout the script and I think it\u0027s a tiny bit better to at least not hardcode the name of the script, just the path.",
