Added instructions in README.md\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I think this is a great idea and we should think about how to use it - maybe we have a periodic job that runs once a day - or even at the start of each promoter run - to run this code and send some alert (irc would be fantastic) \n\u003e \n\nInitial idea was to run it (in unittests) when we are going to add jobs in config file those should be validated. New patch contain cli tool and tests also.\n\n\u003e But i think we should get this initial code in (maybe after some reviews and minor improvements ) and then build on it\n\n+1 :)",
