      Now a local openstack tripleo ci environment has being installed at this
      system to use it you can acces to the following links and use it as a
      normal zuul + gerrit system.

      Gerrit: http://localhost:8080
      Zuul: http://localhost:9000
      Docker compose: {{ install_path }}

      To trigger jobs:
        - git clone http://localhost:8080/test1
        - Add a zuul.yaml with content like this:
          - project:
            check:
              jobs:
                - tripleo-ci-centos-7-scenario002-standalone
        - git review it

      You can also comment with 'recheck' at local gerrit to spin a job
      already commited

  debug:
    msg: "{{ banner.split('\n') }}"
