# These jobs could be handled by rdo-tox-molecule job, when the pytest-molecule
# supports delegated driver, but as delegated tests don't run in isolation,
# tthey may step on eachother's toe, and the first test could pollute the
# environemnt for the second
# So it's probably better to leave them as standalone jobs
